Some general concepts that are regularly used in AWS vocabulary. Mostly, those are industry standard, but there might be some exceptions.

## Availability

Is the percentage of time a workload is available to use. E.g. time available divided by total time. Available (for use) means it performs its agreed function successfully when required.

It is commonly expressed as "number of nines", e.g. five nines means 99.999%.

## Durability

A system that is durable is able to perform its responsibilities over time, even when unexpected events may occur. 
For example, a durable storage system will reliably store data without data loss.

## Elasticity

The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release them when that is no longer the case.

## Reliability 

The ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. 

## Resiliency

The ability of a workload to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
